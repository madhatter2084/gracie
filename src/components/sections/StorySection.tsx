      fullContent: `For 23 years, my reflection was my worst enemy, so I avoided mirrors at all costs. That way maybe my insecurities would magically disappear. Spoiler: they didn't. Since graduating, while it seemed like most of my peers were confidently beginning their journeys of adulthood, I felt like I fell behind still wrestling the question: "Who is really Gracie Kayal?"

Confidence has never been my strong suit. Whether it be in sports, my self-image, being a good enough friend, or holding my own in the classroom. I always felt like I fell short. Though I was lucky to have always been surrounded by support and people who saw potential in me, I couldn't see it for myself.`,

      fullContent: `My swimming career best sums up my low minded mentality. No matter how fast I swam or any achievements I earned, I subconsciously believed I didn't deserve success. I never understood what it meant to take pride in my accomplishments.

I was mostly driven to reach my potential as an athlete solely to make my family and coaches proud. I used swimming as a distraction. It was a mechanism to become recognized by others to hopefully gain a sense of self-worth. I'm understanding now why those motives can only bring you so far.`,

Nothing during this lifestage felt familiar, not even my own sense of self. I was at war internally, working to embrace parts of myself that I had suppressed for years.`,

I think one of the scariest parts of my self-discovery journey is that I'm not doing this behind closed doors‚Äîwhoever wants to follow along has access to witness my shortcomings, my flaws or if you choose to look at it the other way, my growth.

My whole life, I felt pressure to fit some "perfect image," but here's the truth: I am absolutely nowhere near perfect and never will be. I'm learning to fall in love with the journey and messiness of life through songwriting, while challenging myself to be transparent during this learning process.`,

My voice and my ability to create music are gifts and I should use this privilege to try to make the world a little brighter even if at times it still feels uncomfortable for myself.

I'm so excited to continue working toward my next project, to try and best tell my story using this art and share the messy, beautiful process along the way. I'll be documenting it, challenging myself to be present and real for anyone who wants to come along for the ride.
